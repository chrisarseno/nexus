COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT
Version 1.0
Copyright (C) 2025 Christopher R. Arsenault

This Commercial License Agreement (“Agreement”) governs the use of the Software by any individual
or entity (“Licensee”) for commercial purposes. By purchasing, obtaining, or using a commercial
license, the Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement.

1. DEFINITIONS
“Software” refers to all source code, binaries, modules, models, documentation, or other assets
provided by Chris Arsenault and identified as part of this project.

“Commercial Use” means any use of the Software intended for revenue-generating activity, internal
business operations, resale, SaaS hosting, proprietary integration, or deployment within a
commercial product or workflow.

2. GRANT OF LICENSE
A valid Commercial License is granted only upon:
    (a) explicit written approval by the Licensor,
    (b) execution of a Commercial License Agreement signed by both parties,
    (c) full payment of all applicable fees as invoiced by the Licensor, and
    (d) issuance of a unique License ID or License Key by the Licensor.

No commercial rights are granted until all four conditions above are met.
Any commercial use of the Software without a valid License ID constitutes
unauthorized use.

The Licensee bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid commercial
license. Verbal agreements, informal statements, unsigned documents, or payment without written
acceptance do not constitute a license. No implied licenses are granted.

Any misrepresentation regarding the existence or scope of a commercial license
immediately voids all rights and terminates any license that may have been granted.
The Licensor may pursue damages for unauthorized commercial use.

3. RESTRICTIONS
Under this Agreement, Licensee may NOT:
    a. Re-license or sell the Software itself
    b. Publish the source code of the Software
    c. Release a competing open-source version
    d. Claim authorship or remove copyright or attribution

4. NO WARRANTY
The Software is provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind. Licensor shall not be liable for any
damages arising from use or misuse of the Software under any legal theory.

5. TERMINATION

termination, Licensee must immediately cease all use of the Software.
